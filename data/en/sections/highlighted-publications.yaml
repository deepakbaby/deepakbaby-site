- title: "A convolutional neural-network model of human cochlear mechanics and filter tuning for real-time applications"
  publishedIn:
    name: Nature Machine Intelligence
    date: February 2021
    url: https://www.nature.com/natmachintell/
  authors:
  - name: D. Baby
  - name: A. Van Den Broucke
  - name: S. Verhulst
  paper:
    summary: "A hybrid approach combining convolutional neural networks with computational neuroscience to yield a real-time end-to-end model for human cochlear mechanics, including level-dependent filter tuning (CoNNear). The model accurately simulates human cochlear frequency selectivity and its dependence on sound intensity."
