&lt;p>Flow-based deep generative models have not gained much attention in the research community when compared to &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">GANs&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114">VAEs&lt;/a>. This post discusses a flow-based model called &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516">NICE&lt;/a>, its advantages over the other generative models and finally an implementation in Keras.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While VAEs use an encoder that finds only an approximation of the latent variable corresponding to a datapoint, GANs doesnt even have an encoder to infer latents. In flow-based models, the latent variables can be infered exactly without any approximation. Flow-based models make use of reversible architecture (which will be explained below) which enables accurate inference, in addition to providing optimization over the exact log-likelihood of the data instead of a lower bound of it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
